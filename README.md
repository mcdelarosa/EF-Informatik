If you want to download the numtrip game just install the whole numtrip file and run it with python via IDEs (VS Code, Intellij IDEA, etc.)
This is a demo from numtrip:

There are other games like the hangman and other programs which you can download from the file exercises, but Numtrip doesn't require any of these.
Then there is my website, which sadly is written in German...
